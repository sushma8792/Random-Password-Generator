                    A password generator is a tool that automatically generates a password based on guidelines that you set to create strong and unpredictable passwords for each of your accounts.
                  
                       <br> Good password generators do the following:
                    <br>-> Adjust guidelines to fit different sites' unique password requirements 
                    
                    <br>-> Generate strong passwords using secure technology with built-in randomness
                    <br>-> Copy the strong password in one click 
        
            </div>
            <div>
                    <p><span class="question">What's a strong password anyway?</span><br>
               
                    ->  Long: The longer a password, the more secure it is. A strong password should be at least 12 characters long.
                        
               <br>->  Random: Strong passwords use a combination of letters, numbers, cases,<br> and symbols to form an unpredictable string of characters that doesn't resemble words or names.
                        
                   <br> ->  Unique: A strong password should be unique to each account to <br>reduce vulnerability in the event of a hack.

                    Hackers crack passwords with programs that test millions of alternatives in a second. Even so, cracking complex passwords could still take millions of years. The following factors make your password virtually unbreakable.

                    It ia unique — your password unlocks only one account, app, etc.
                    It is at least 12 characters long
                    It includes uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols
                    It cannot be guessed
                    It is not commonly used — like password, 123456, qwerty, etc.

                    Having a strong password makes it harder for criminals to steal your personal details. When you use a single password only for one account, criminals cannot break into all your accounts with just one stolen password.

                    <br>Many online accounts include valuable personal details, like a phone number, credit card number, home address, birth date, etc. These details can be used to impersonate you online. Hackers could also log in to, for example, your Netflix or Amazon account, with a stolen password. If they change your password, you lose your account.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Remembering strong passwords can be difficult, especially if you use a password generator to create them. Make storing and remembering your passwords easier by using a password manager. This way you will never forget your passwords and they are always at hand.

                    Often a password app is also a strong password generator. You can copy your passwords when needed, or even use autofill to let the app do that for you. It is safer, faster, and easier than any other password practice.</p>

                <p>A strong password can be cracked, but you can make it virtually impossible for criminals. Hackers use programs to crack passwords. They can try out millions of alternatives in a second. That is why passwords should be long and complex. If your password is strong enough, it could take millions of years to crack it with current technology. However, even if you use a password generator for creating your secure passwords, criminals can still steal them, or trick you into giving them away.</p>
